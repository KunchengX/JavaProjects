## Feedback

- Xuanyu was concentrated on during class

- Need be aware of the difference between the `Constructor` and the `Getter`

- Needs a clearer understanding of the scope of functions, nesting levels, and the meaning of curly braces `{}`

- Please share exercises and homeworks earlier so the teacher could be more prepared to make it easire to absorb for the student

- Class paste should be slower for student to digest
